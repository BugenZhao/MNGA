# MNGA Project Explained for Agents

## Project Structure

MNGA consists of two main components:

- **SwiftUI UI Module** - Handles user interface and interactions
- **Rust Business Module** - Handles core business logic, networking, and data processing

The two modules communicate via FFI using Protocol Buffers for data exchange.

## Rust Logic Module

This section covers the design and implementation of the Rust-based business module.

### Layout

- `logic/service`: Tokio-based crate that implements business services and exposes `dispatch_async`/`dispatch_sync` for the Swift bridge.
- `logic/protos`: Protobuf wrapper crate; `build.rs` regenerates Rust types in `logic/protos/src/generated` from shared `.proto` files.
- Supporting crates: `logic/text` (rich-text parsing), `logic/cache` (sled-backed cache), and `logic/config` (runtime configuration) are all consumed by `logic/service`.

### Proto Sources

- `protos/DataModel.proto` defines shared models such as `Topic`, `User`, `Post`, and enums used on both sides of the bridge.
- `protos/Service.proto` defines the `SyncRequest` and `AsyncRequest` oneofs plus every request/response pair that `logic/service` dispatches.
- Building `logic/protos` (e.g., via `cargo check -p logic-service`, `make logic-sim`, or the iOS builds) reruns `logic/protos/build.rs` to update the generated Rust bindings; remember to run `make swift-pb` after proto edits so Swift stays in sync.

### Adding a Service

1. Extend `protos/Service.proto` (and `DataModel.proto` if new types are needed) with the request/response messages and place the new entry in either `SyncRequest.value` or `AsyncRequest.value`.
2. Regenerate protobuf bindings by rebuilding the Rust crate (`cargo check -p logic-service` is enough) and re-run `make swift-pb` for Swift stubs.
3. Implement the business logic in `logic/service/src`, creating a new module if the functionality does not fit an existing one.
4. Register the handler:
   - Async services: add a `handle!(service_name, function_name);` line in `logic/service/src/dispatch/handlers_async.rs`.
   - Sync services: add a wrapper in `logic/service/src/dispatch/handlers_sync.rs` and match the new variant in `dispatch_sync` inside `logic/service/src/dispatch/mod.rs`.
5. If the service needs caching or shared state, reuse the helpers in `logic/cache`, `logic/text`, and `logic/service/src/utils.rs` to stay consistent with existing code.

### Existing Services

Services under `logic/service/src`:

- `request.rs`: stores and mutates the global `RequestOption`, including base URL overrides and custom user agents.
- `auth.rs`: keeps the current `AuthInfo` in memory and exposes `set_auth`/`current_uid`.
- `cache.rs`: implements `CacheRequest` handling with prefix-based cache scans and clears.
- `clock_in.rs`: `clock_in` endpoint that memoizes daily sign-ins per user via the shared cache.
- `forum.rs`: forum discovery (`get_forum_list`), subforum subscription management (`set_subforum_filter`), and forum search.
- `topic.rs`: core topic workflowsâ€”forum topic lists, topic details, hot topics, favorites/folders, topic search, per-user topic feeds, and related extraction helpers.
- `post.rs`: post-level operations including vote tracking, reply flows (`post_reply`, `post_reply_fetch_content`), attachment uploads, hot replies/comments parsing, and per-user post history.
- `history.rs`: stores topic snapshots in cache and serves `get_topic_history`.
- `msg.rs`: handles short message conversations (`get_short_msg_list`, `get_short_msg_details`, `post_short_msg`) and participant parsing.
- `noti.rs`: notification fetch (`fetch_notis`), normalization, caching, and synchronous `mark_noti_read`.
- `user.rs`: shared `UserController`, anonymous ID handling, and the `get_remote_user` service.
- `attachment.rs`: converts attachment nodes into `Attachment` models for post rendering.

## Development Workflow

### After updating Rust code

```bash
make logic-ios
```

Compiles a new logic framework for Swift to link against.

### After updating .proto files

```bash
make swift-pb
```

Generates Swift protobuf code. Rust protobuf code is generated automatically during compilation.

## Common Commands

- `make logic-ios` - Build iOS framework
- `make swift-pb` - Generate Swift protobuf code
- `make logic-sim` - Build simulator-only version (faster for development)
- `make logic-deploy` - Build production version

## Important Notes

- Avoid any Chinese in source code, including comments and string literals.
- The project is targeting iOS 26. Note that this is NOT a typo. Apple released iOS 26 in 2025.
- APIs of SwiftUI is evolving very fast. Always refer to the latest documentation via `sosumi` MCP server.
